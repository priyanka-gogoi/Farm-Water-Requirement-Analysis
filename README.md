# Farm-Water-Requirement-Analysis

*For DoubleSLash Hackathon*

Water scarcity is a major problem in the world and methods to save water have to be found out. Agriculture is a sector which depends on large amounts of water for crop growth. There is a heavy possibility of wastage of water in this area which needs to be prevented.

This is a web-app which determines the water requirement of a crop depending on various factors like temperature, humidity, etc. so that the farmer knows how much amount of water to use.

This is made using HTML, CSS, Flask and Machine learning(Linear Regression)
